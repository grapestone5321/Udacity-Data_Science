Learn What It Takes to Become a Data Scientist

The Introduction to Data Science class will survey the foundational topics in data science, namely:

- Data Manipulation

- Data Analysis with Statistics and Machine Learning

- Data Communication with Information Visualization

- Data at Scale -- Working with Big Data

The class will focus on breadth and present the topics briefly instead of focusing on a single topic in depth. 

This will give you the opportunity to sample and apply the basic techniques of data science.

This course is also a part of our Data Analyst Nanodegree.
